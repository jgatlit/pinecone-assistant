## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture: 3-Layer System

```
Layer 1: RAG Search
  ↓ Vector search returns matches with storage_path

Layer 2: Citation Generation
  ↓ generateCitationUrls() creates signed URLs

Layer 3: Frontend Display
  ↓ Citations rendered with icons, links, percentages
```

### Key Components

1. **Backend Citation Generation** (`src/lib/rag.ts:232-327`)
   - Function: `generateCitationUrls(matches, expirySeconds)`
   - Deduplicates documents by ID
   - Generates Supabase Storage signed URLs
   - Sorts by relevance
   - Handles errors gracefully

2. **Server Action Enhancement** (`src/app/actions.ts:106-197`)
   - Updated `chat()` to call citation generator
   - Returns both streamed text AND citations
   - Enhanced system prompt for LLM awareness

3. **Frontend Display** (`src/app/home.tsx:101-279`)
   - Receives citations from server action
   - Renders with PDF icons and relevance %
   - Full dark mode support
   - Mobile responsive

4. **Database Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20251029_add_storage_path_to_search.sql`)
   - Updated `match_sbwc_document_sections` function
   - Now returns `storage_path` field
   - Enables URL generation

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14.2.5, React 18, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Server Actions, Supabase
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 17.6, pgvector
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage with signed URLs
- **Deployment:** Railway
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Monitoring:** LangSmith
