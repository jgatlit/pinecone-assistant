## Database Migration Required

### ⚠️ ACTION NEEDED

The chat history RLS policies migration has NOT been applied yet. This needs to be done for the feature to work properly.

**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/20251029_chat_history_rls_policies.sql`

**What It Creates:**
- RLS policies for `sbwc_chat_sessions` table
- RLS policies for `sbwc_chat_messages` table
- Indexes for performance (session_id, user_id, created_at)
- Security policies for user data isolation

**How to Apply:**

**Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Open Supabase project: https://sb.aichemist.agency
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251029_chat_history_rls_policies.sql`
4. Run the SQL script
5. Verify tables and policies created

**Option 2: Via psql (if SSH tunnel available)**
```bash
# Connect via SSH tunnel
ssh -L 5433:127.0.0.1:54322 jgatlit@82.25.85.116

# In another terminal
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/postgres?sslmode=disable" \
  < supabase/migrations/20251029_chat_history_rls_policies.sql
```

**Option 3: Using Node.js script**
```bash
node scripts/apply-migration.js supabase/migrations/20251029_chat_history_rls_policies.sql
```

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### For Users
1. **First Visit**
   - Session automatically created
   - Can start chatting immediately
   - Messages persist to database

2. **Page Refresh**
   - Session ID loaded from database
   - Message history restored
   - Citations preserved

3. **Continued Use**
   - Single continuous conversation
   - All messages saved automatically
   - No data loss on browser close

### For Developers
1. **Database Tables**
   ```sql
   -- One session per user (temporary: all share same ID)
   SELECT * FROM sbwc_chat_sessions;

   -- All messages in chronological order
   SELECT * FROM sbwc_chat_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Logs to Monitor**
   ```bash
   railway logs

   # Look for:
   # ✅ "Session created: <uuid>"
   # ✅ "Loaded X messages from history"
   # ✅ "Message saved successfully"
   # ❌ "Error..." (any Supabase connection errors)
   ```

3. **Browser Console**
   ```javascript
   // Should see:
   console.log('Session ID:', sessionId);  // UUID
   console.log('Loaded messages:', messages.length);  // N
   console.log('Message saved:', success);  // true
   ```

## Testing Checklist (Post-Deployment)

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Open production URL
- [ ] Send a test message
- [ ] Verify message appears in chat
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Verify message history loads
- [ ] Send another message
- [ ] Verify both messages persist
- [ ] Check citations are clickable
- [ ] Test dark mode compatibility

### Database Verification
- [ ] Connect to Supabase
- [ ] Verify `sbwc_chat_sessions` table has 1 row
- [ ] Verify `sbwc_chat_messages` table has test messages
- [ ] Check `metadata` column has references (for assistant messages)
- [ ] Verify timestamps are correct

### Error Monitoring
- [ ] Check Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test with network throttling
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Verify performance is acceptable

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Temporary Limitations (By Design)
1. **Single User Mode**
   - All users share session with ID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
   - No user authentication yet
   - Acceptable for internal/single-user deployment

2. **No Session Management UI**
   - Single continuous conversation only
   - No way to start new chat threads
   - No session deletion
   - Phase 2 will add these features

3. **Admin Client Bypasses RLS**
   - Using service role key (admin privileges)
   - Bypasses row-level security
   - Necessary until authentication is added

### Potential Issues
1. **Migration Not Applied**
   - If tables don't exist, chat history will fail silently
   - Messages won't persist (but chat still works)
   - **Fix:** Apply migration as described above

2. **Environment Variables Missing**
   - Already verified in Railway
   - Should not be an issue

3. **First Load Performance**
   - Initial session creation adds ~200ms
   - History load adds ~100-500ms (depends on message count)
   - Acceptable for UX

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails or critical bugs discovered:

### Option 1: Revert to Previous Deployment
```bash
# Via Railway dashboard
# Go to Deployments → Select previous deployment → Redeploy
```

### Option 2: Revert Git Commits
```bash
git revert HEAD~3  # Revert last 3 commits (chat history)
git push fork main --force
railway up
```

### Option 3: Feature Flag Disable
```typescript
// In src/app/home.tsx, comment out session initialization:
// useEffect(() => {
//   const initializeSession = async () => { ... }
// }, []);
```

## Support & Debugging

### Deployment Fails
1. Check Railway build logs for errors
2. Verify package.json dependencies
3. Check TypeScript compilation errors
4. Ensure environment variables set

### Chat History Not Working
1. Verify migration applied: `SELECT * FROM sbwc_chat_sessions LIMIT 1;`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Check Railway logs for Supabase connection errors
4. Verify environment variables in Railway

### Performance Issues
1. Check Railway metrics (CPU, memory)
2. Check database query performance
3. Consider adding message pagination
4. Monitor Supabase dashboard

### Need Help
