## 📈 Monitoring Recommendations

### Metrics to Track

1. **Citation Generation Success Rate**
   ```
   Target: > 95%
   Monitor: Error logs in application
   Alert if: < 90% success rate
   ```

2. **User Engagement with Citations**
   ```
   Target: > 30% of users click citations
   Monitor: Analytics on citation link clicks
   Measure: Conversion rate
   ```

3. **URL Expiry Issues**
   ```
   Target: < 5% expired URL encounters
   Monitor: 404 errors or expired URL feedback
   Action: Consider increasing expiry time
   ```

4. **Storage API Usage**
   ```
   Monitor: Supabase Storage API calls
   Track: createSignedUrl() calls per hour
   Alert if: Approaching plan limits
   ```

### Logging

Current implementation logs:
- ✅ Individual URL generation failures
- ✅ Catastrophic citation generation errors
- ✅ RAG search completions (via LangSmith)

**Recommended additions:**
- Citation generation success count
- Average URL generation time
- Most frequently cited documents
- User citation click events

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Current Settings:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://sb.aichemist.agency
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[REDACTED]
SHOW_CITATIONS=true  # Default if not set
```

### Storage Configuration

---

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If issues arise and rollback is necessary:

### 1. Database Rollback
```sql
-- Revert to original function without storage_path
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS match_sbwc_document_sections(vector, double precision, integer, uuid[]);

-- Recreate original function (without storage_path)
-- [Use backup of previous function definition]
```

### 2. Code Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous git commit
git revert HEAD

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Redeploy
```

### 3. Feature Toggle
```env
